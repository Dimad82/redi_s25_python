# A. donuts
# Given an int count of a number of donuts, return a string
# of the form 'Number of donuts: <count>', where <count> is the number
# passed in. However, if the count is 10 or more, then use the word 'many'
# instead of the actual count.
# So donuts(5) returns 'Number of donuts: 5'
# and donuts(23) returns 'Number of donuts: many'
def donuts(count):
  # +++your code here+++
  return


# B. both_ends
# Given a string s, return a string made of the first 2
# and the last 2 chars of the original string,
# so 'spring' yields 'spng'. However, if the string length
# is less than 2, return instead the empty string.
def both_ends(s):
    # +++your code here+++
    return


# C. fix_start
# Given a string s, return a string
# where all occurences of its first char have
# been changed to '*', except do not change
# the first char itself.
# e.g. 'babble' yields 'ba**le'
# Assume that the string is length 1 or more.
# Hint: s.replace(stra, strb) returns a version of string s
# where all instances of stra have been replaced by strb.
def fix_start(a):
    first_char = a[0]
    return first_char + a[1:].replace(first_char, "*")

# Provided simple test() function used in main() to print
# what each function returns vs. what it's supposed to return.
def test(got, expected):
  if got == expected:
    prefix = ' OK '
  else:
    prefix = '  X '
  print(f'{prefix} got: {got} expected: {expected}')


# D. verbing
# Given a string, if its length is at least 3,
# add 'ing' to its end.
# Unless it already ends in 'ing', in which case
# add 'ly' instead.
# If the string length is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
# Return the resulting string.
def verbing(s):
  # +++your code here+++
  return


# E. not_bad
# Given a string, find the first appearance of the
# substring 'not' and 'bad'. If the 'bad' follows
# the 'not', replace the whole 'not'...'bad' substring
# with 'good'.
# Return the resulting string.
# So 'This dinner is not that bad!' yields:
# This dinner is good!
def not_bad(s):
  # +++your code here+++
  return


# Provided main() calls the above functions with interesting inputs,
# using test() to check if each result is correct or not.
def main():
  print('donuts')
  # Each line calls donuts, compares its result to the expected for that call.
