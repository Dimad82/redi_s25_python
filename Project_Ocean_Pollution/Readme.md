# Project Oceans Pollution data visualisation

## App that shows which Ocean has how many garbage floating on the Ocean surface. 

## Inspiration
I am very passionate about the planet and how we humans impact it. I build a simple app that is showing pollution in oceans.

## What should do
It will open the map using external libraries like Streamlit. User should hover over the points and it should show the name of the Ocean and how many Pollution in tons is there. Small questionary is included for the interaction with users, if they recycle or not with recommendation.

## Installations
pip install streamlit
pip install pandas 
pip install pydeck
pip install logging

## Import  
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import pydeck as pdk
import logging
 
## Requirements:
- Code
- OOP
- Streamlit
- PyDeck
- DataFrame
- Readme
- Virtual Enviroment
- Logging
- Database is localy stored with DataFrame

## How to run it
streamlit run Ocean_Pollution.py

Idea for pydeck.py to hover over the Points.
